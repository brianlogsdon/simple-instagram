# Simple-instagram
4Geeks Academy simple-instagram project created with html and css.
# What I Learned
* Using everything I have learned with HTML and CSS3 to create a website that replicates this picture https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=instagram-feed&preview in every way (pixel perfect).

* Use the display property like in the old days or the new flex CSS property to make the posts feed.
